# ArduNet
ArduNet is an android application designed to graph sensor data using BLE (bluetooth low-energy). This application was designed to work with the ESP 32 LoRa V2 microcontroller, but is also compatible with any device with a BLE chip capable of braodcasting.
\
Graphing is done on a seperate multi-threaded process, enabling data recording in the background even when app is not in focus.

# Features
* Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices
* Record sensor data (x,y) into .csv format
* Export .csv files to Gmail, Outlook or Google Drives

# File Saving
After recording data, the files will automatically be saved in the following format:\
Example: `ESP32_10-30-2020(9_30_02).csv` \
\
ESP32 is the device name, 10-30-2020 is the date, and 9_30_02 corresponds to 9:30:02 military time.  These values will change depending on the packet transmitted.

# How to Use
## Set up Service and Characteristic
Set your Bluetooth device to transmit the packet under the following default service and characteristic UUID.  The app will only display data if it matches these UUIDs.
* Service UUID: `4fafc201-1fb5-459e-8fcc-c5c9c331914b`
* Characteristic UUID: `beb5483e-36e1-4688-b7f5-ea07361b26a8`

## Characteristic Packet Format
Broadcast the BLE packet with the following packet format\
`AXXX/BXXX/CXXX/DXXX/EXXX/FXXX/GXXX/HXXX/IXXX/JXXX/KXXX/LXXX/MXXX`
\
\
Each packet is delimited using a `/` character and is uniquely identified by a letter ranging from A to M.  \
`XXX` represents the value associated with the letter ID.

A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M
